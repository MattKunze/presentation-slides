# Slides for Various Talks and Presentations

These slide decks use [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/). To run
locally you need to serve up the content with a local http server, so
something like the following should work:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/MattKunze/reveal-presentations
$ cd reveal-presentations
$ npm install
$ http-serve .
