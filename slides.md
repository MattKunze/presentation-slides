## React CLI

Many starter kits and templates, `create-react-app` is probably the easiest
to get started:

```
npm i -g create-react-app
create-react-app new-app
```

---

## Angular CLI
- Angular CLI: create an app with best practices
- Simplest way to get started:

  ```
  npm install -g @angular/cli
  ng new PROJECT_NAME
  cd PROJECT_NAME
  ng serve
  ```

- Your app is running at localhost:4200
- ng generate: scaffolding for components, pipes, services, etc
- what else: `ng build` (webpack), `ng test` (jasmine/karma), `ng e2e` (protractor), `ng lint`, `ng build`, `ng eject`
